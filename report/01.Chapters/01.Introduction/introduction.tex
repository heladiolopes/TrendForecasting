Recently, the growth of artificial intelligence has been helping us to solve problems in the most various Ã¡reas, including in linguistics. With natural language processing techniques, computers are able to process text in order to extract information faster than humans.


\section{Motivation}

Every kind of expression, verbal or in writing, brings us a lot of information to be interpreted. Whether the topic is chosen, the tone used or the choice of words, everything can be interpreted, and then generate some useful information. Over the years, more and more knowledge is generated and we humans are not able to process such an amount of information. Natural language processing emerges as a technology capable of assisting us in this hard task.

\citeonline{state_of_the_art} defines natural language processing, abbreviated by NLP, as a branch of artificial intelligence capable of making computers understand and extract information from human language. NLP can perform a lot of tasks, such as identifying different topics for a set of documents, classifying texts on predefined subjects, and beyond that extract the sentiment to know what people are saying about something.

\section{Objective}

Curious about the fast world's evolution, this works aims to explore and compare a several Natural Language Processing techniques to model the topic's evolution over time. With this in mind, evaluate te ability of those models to make predictions about future trends.
