In view of the problem's complexity, we can elaborate a schedule with the proposed tasks in the previous chapter. Starting from August 3rd until November 9th we have 14 weeks, so we can divide the work into 5 sprints, 4 of them with 3 weeks, and the remain on with 2 weeks. The Table \ref{tab:roadmap-table} show the tasks over the remains months until the end of this work.
