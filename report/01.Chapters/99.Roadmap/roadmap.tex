Because of the problem's complexity, we can elaborate on a schedule with the proposed tasks in the previous chapter. Starting from August 3rd until November 9th we have 14 weeks, so we can divide the work into 6 sprints, 4 of them with 2 weeks, and the remainder two with 3 weeks. The Table \ref{tab:roadmap-table} show the tasks over the remaining months until the end of this work.

\end{table}

In the table, we see that the forecasting step was not included in the schedule. Due to the high complexity of each stage, for this work, it will be implemented only up to the stage of the classification model. The last stage, with the forecast, will be for future work
