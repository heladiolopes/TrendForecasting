With scientific and technological advances on global scales, the availability of data to be analyzed grows exponentially. Based on this accelerated growth, artificial intelligence techniques, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), increasingly help to automate the process of extracting information from documents. In order to make predictions about the trends that will arise from data growth, it is possible to use topic modeling techniques to group documents on similar clusters and study the temporal incidence of those topics.
Thereby, this work aims to apply NLP techniques combined with supervised learning to group documents into a set of themes and from there learn to identify them in new documents in a future period. Using scientific publications from the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, we were able to model this task and obtain good results. We also studied the classifiers' ability to keep a satisfactory performance over time.
